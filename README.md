# Manual Testing Exercise2

## Project Overview  
This repository is dedicated to manual testing of a simple "Offer Creation Form" interface. The form includes features such as dropdowns, numeric input fields, date pickers, and validation requirements. The goal is to validate all functional and non-functional aspects of this interface.


## Key Features of the Interface  
1. **Offer Name**:  
   - Allows 4â€“6 character inputs only.  
2. **Product 1 & Product 2 (Dropdowns)**:  
   - Selectable options (e.g., A, B, C).  
3. **Numbers Input**:  
   - Accepts numeric values for calculations like "Number of Redundant" and "Gain/Outcome."  
4. **Date Pickers**:  
   - Includes start and end date fields with calendar selection.  
5. **Create Button**:  
   - Finalizes the offer creation process.



## Test Cases  
The test cases focus on the following aspects:  
- **Validation**: Ensuring correct input for all fields (e.g., name length, numeric inputs).  
- **UI Elements**: Verifying dropdowns, buttons, and fields work as expected.  
- **Functional Testing**: Checking form logic, calculations, and edge cases.  
- **Boundary Testing**: Testing inputs at their min/max limits.
